# Artificial Intelligence Physician Assistant
This project is a physician assistant to help doctors in the diagnostic phase. Based on the patient information entered by doctors, it analyzes it using Gemini 2.0 based on visual and clinical information about the patient. It lists the preliminary diagnoses that may be related to the patient entered.

It is a project designed for doctors to select the diseases that they can consider at the forefront according to their own opinions and continue further research. Thanks to this program, more preliminary diagnoses can be identified and a faster and better diagnosis can be made.
